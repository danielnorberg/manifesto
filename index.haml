      Haters Manifesto
      ================

      1. **Hatters gonna hate.**  
        The collective rage against crap software is unstoppable.
      2. **Dislike is not hatred.**  
        Keep looking.
      3. **No code is quality code.**  
        There's code that fails and code that has yet to fail.
        Tonight, probably. During sex.
      4. **Happiness comes from inaction, delusion, or both.**  
        If you're doing it right, you resent all of it.
