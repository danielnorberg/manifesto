      Hate Driven Development Manifesto (WIP)
      =======================================

      1. **Dislike is not hatred.**  
        Keep looking. You're getting there.
      1. **Hatters gonna hate.**  
        The collective rage against crap software is unstoppable.
      1. **Happiness comes from inaction, delusion, or both.**  
        If you're doing it right, you resent all of it.
      1. **There is no dignity in staying positive or constructive.**  
        When the wagon goes downhill, jump off and start climbing.
      1. **No code is quality code.**  
        There's code that fails and code that has yet to fail.
        Tonight, probably. During sex.
      1. **Architectures, requirements, and designs become irrelevant**  
         when pulling architects, customers and teams out the way,
         and getting shit done.
